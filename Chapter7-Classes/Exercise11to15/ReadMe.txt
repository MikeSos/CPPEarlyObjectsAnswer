Programming Challenge Problems 11 through 15 require the use of #include <windows.h>, which requires the Windows OS, an OS I do not use. 

I use a Mac, so I am unable to do these problems, and am not going to spend time setting up a virtual windows environment at this moment for the sole purpose of solving these problems. 

These problems will not be solved by me. If you use Windows, and solve them, please contact me and I'll update the exercise file and give you credit for it. 

Sorry for the inconvenience.
