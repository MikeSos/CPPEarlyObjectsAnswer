These are programming challenge problems from the book C++ Early Objects Eighth Edition.

These answers are not in the back of the book, and to get them would require ordering an instructor handbook.

I have decided to do these problems for extra practice for myself, and for anyone who is stuck on a problem 
and needs help or wants to compare their answer to someone elses. 

All of these were done by me, Michael Sosnowski. You can get in contact with me through my website at

In the next 90 days, most of the programming challenge problems from Chapter 6 to the end of the book should be added.
